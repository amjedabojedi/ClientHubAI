# TherapyFlow Notification System Guide

## How the Notification System Works

The notification system automatically monitors your therapy practice and sends alerts when important events happen. It uses **Triggers** (what to watch for) and **Templates** (what message to send).

### System Flow:
1. **Event Happens** â†’ Something occurs in your system (client assigned, task overdue, etc.)
2. **Trigger Checks** â†’ System checks if any triggers match this event
3. **Conditions Evaluated** â†’ If conditions are met, notification is created
4. **Template Applied** â†’ Message is generated using the template
5. **Notification Sent** â†’ Alert is delivered to the right person

## Setting Up Effective Triggers

### Best Practices:
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic triggers (client assignments, task overdue)
2. **Use Conditions**: Filter for specific priorities, client types, or therapists
3. **Test First**: Create triggers with yourself as recipient to test functionality
4. **Review Regularly**: Adjust trigger conditions based on actual workflow needs
5. **Avoid Spam**: Don't create too many overlapping triggers

### Common Condition Examples:
- `{"priority": "high"}` - Only high priority items
- `{"therapistId": "17"}` - Only for specific therapist
- `{"clientType": "new"}` - Only for new clients
- `{"priority": "urgent", "clientStatus": "active"}` - Multiple conditions

This system ensures that critical events in your therapy practice never go unnoticed and appropriate actions are taken promptly.
