The overall symptom pattern reflects a combination of cognitive and somatic symptoms, marked by intense physiological arousal and persistent fear-based cognition. Although panic attacks were not reported, the breadth and severity of symptoms suggest a substantial impact on daily functioning. Mr. Abojedi demonstrated awareness of his mental health challenges and expressed openness to pursuing therapeutic support.



PTSD CHECKLIST – CIVILIAN VERSION (PCL-C)


Mr. Abojedi completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL), a 17-item standardized self-report measure designed to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress over the past month, based on DSM-IV criteria. He obtained a total score of 52, which exceeds the clinical threshold and is indicative of significant post-traumatic stress symptomatology.



Mr. Abojedi endorsed the highest level of severity (score of 5) across the following domains: none. A moderate symptom (score of 4) was reported for repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts, or images of a stressful experience from the past; repeated, disturbing dreams of a stressful experience from the past; suddenly acting or feeling as if a stressful experience were happening again (as if you were reliving it); feeling very upset when something reminded you of a stressful experience from the past; having physical reactions (e.g., heart pounding, trouble breathing, or sweating) when something reminded you of a stressful experience from the past; avoid thinking about or talking about a stressful experience from the past or avoid having feelings related to it; avoid activities or situations because they remind you of a stressful experience from the past; trouble remembering important parts of a stressful experience from the past; loss of interest in things that you used to enjoy; feeling distant or cut off from other people; feeling emotionally numb or being unable to have loving feelings for those close to you; feeling as if your future will somehow be cut short; trouble falling or staying asleep; feeling irritable or having angry outbursts; having difficulty concentrating; being “super alert” or watchful on guard; feeling jumpy or easily startled. A mild symptom (score of 1–3) was not noted in any specific domain.



The overall pattern reflects a trauma response characterized by re-experiencing/intrusions, avoidance of trauma-related cues, emotional numbing or detachment, and hyperarousal or vigilance. This profile suggests persistent psychological distress with a substantial impact on daily functioning. These findings support the need for focused, trauma-informed intervention to address the underlying emotional and cognitive consequences of past trauma.
