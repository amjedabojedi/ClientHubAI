BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY BAI


Mr. Soufan was administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21-item standardized self-report instrument used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms experienced during the week preceding the assessment. He obtained a total score of 39, which falls within the severe range of anxiety symptomatology.



Severe symptoms (score of 3) were reported across the following areas: heart pounding/racing and indigestion. A moderate symptom (score of 2) was reported in numbness or tingling, feeling hot, wobbliness in legs, unable to relax, dizzy or lightheaded, unsteady, terrified or afraid, nervous, feeling of choking, shaky/unsteady, fear of losing control, difficulty in breathing, fear of dying, scared, faint/lightheaded, face flushed, and hot/cold sweats. Items rated with a score of 0 (not endorsed) included none.



The overall symptom pattern reflects a combination of cognitive and somatic symptoms, marked by intense physiological arousal and persistent fear-based cognition. Although panic attacks were not reported, the breadth and severity of symptoms suggest a substantial impact on daily functioning. Mr. Soufan demonstrated awareness of his mental health challenges and expressed openness to pursuing therapeutic support.



PTSD CHECKLIST – CIVILIAN VERSION (PCL-C)


Mr. Soufan completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL), a 17-item standardized self-report measure designed to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress over the past month, based on DSM-IV criteria. He obtained a total score of 65, which exceeds the clinical threshold and is indicative of significant post-traumatic stress symptomatology.



Mr. Soufan endorsed the highest level of severity (score of 5) across the following domains: being "super alert" or watchful on guard. A moderate symptom (score of 4) was reported for repeated, disturbing dreams of a stressful experience from the past, feeling very upset when something reminded him of a stressful experience from the past, having physical reactions when reminded of a stressful experience, avoiding thinking about or talking about a stressful experience, avoiding activities or situations because they remind him of a stressful experience, trouble remembering important parts of a stressful experience, feeling emotionally numb, feeling distant or cut off from other people, trouble falling or staying asleep, feeling irritable or having angry outbursts, and having difficulty concentrating.



The overall pattern reflects a trauma response characterized by re-experiencing, avoidance of trauma-related cues, emotional numbing or detachment, and hyperarousal or vigilance. This profile suggests persistent psychological distress with a substantial impact on daily functioning. These findings support the need for focused, trauma-informed intervention to address the underlying emotional and cognitive consequences of past trauma.
