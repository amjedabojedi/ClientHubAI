BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY BAI


Mr. Soufan was administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21-item standardized self-report instrument used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms experienced during the week preceding the assessment. He obtained a total score of 45, which falls within the Severe range of anxiety symptomatology.



Severe symptoms (score of 3) were reported across the following areas: heart pounding/racing and indigestion. Moderate symptoms (score of 2) were reported in numbness or tingling, unable to relax, feeling hot, dizzy or lightheaded, unsteady, nervous, terrified or afraid, shaky/unsteady, feeling of choking, fear of dying, fear of losing control, difficulty in breathing, faint/lightheaded, scared, and hot/cold sweats. Mild symptoms were not reported.



The overall symptom pattern reflects a combination of cognitive and somatic symptoms, marked by intense physiological arousal and persistent fear-based cognition. Although panic attacks were not reported, the breadth and severity of symptoms suggest a substantial impact on daily functioning. Mr. Soufan demonstrated awareness of his mental health challenges and expressed openness to pursuing therapeutic support.



PTSD CHECKLIST â€“ CIVILIAN VERSION (PCL-C)


Mr. Soufan completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL), a 17-item standardized self-report measure designed to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress over the past month, based on DSM-IV criteria. He obtained a total score of 55, which exceeds the clinical threshold and is indicative of significant post-traumatic stress symptomatology.



Mr. Soufan endorsed the highest level of severity (score of 5) across the domains of hypervigilance. A moderate symptom (score of 4) was reported for intrusive memories, avoidance, emotional numbing, sleep disturbance, and concentration difficulties, while mild symptoms were noted in re-experiencing and emotional detachment.



The overall pattern reflects a trauma response characterized by re-experiencing, avoidance of trauma-related cues, emotional detachment, and hyperarousal. This profile suggests persistent psychological distress with a substantial impact on daily functioning. These findings support the need for focused, trauma-informed intervention to address the underlying emotional and cognitive consequences of past trauma.
