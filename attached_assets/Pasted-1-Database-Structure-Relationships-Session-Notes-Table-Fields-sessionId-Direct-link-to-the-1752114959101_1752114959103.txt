2. How Session Notes Connect to Sessions
Direct Relationship:

Session (ID: 123) â†’ Session Note (sessionId: 123)
Database Relations:

Each Session can have multiple Session Notes (one-to-many)
Each Session Note belongs to exactly one Session (many-to-one)
Session Notes inherit client and therapist from the session
Date is automatically populated from session date
3. Session Note Creation Process
When a Session is Created:

Session gets scheduled with basic info (client, therapist, date, time)
Session Note can be created during or after the session
Note automatically links to the session via sessionId
All session details (client, therapist, date) auto-populate
Session Note Workflow:

Draft Creation - Note starts as draft (isDraft: true)
AI Generation - Optional AI-assisted content creation
Manual Editing - Therapist edits/refines content
Finalization - Note marked as complete (isFinalized: true)
