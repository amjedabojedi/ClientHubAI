BECK BDI II


Mr. Soufan was administered the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II), a 21-item standardized self-report measure designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms over the two weeks preceding the assessment. Unfortunately, specific scores and severity classifications were not provided, leaving this section incomplete.





Details about any endorsed symptoms, including severity levels, and whether suicidal thoughts were present, were also not recorded. Consequently, the potential impact on Mr. Soufan’s mental health and his insight into these symptoms remain areas for further evaluation. 

BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY BAI


Mr. Soufan was administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21-item standardized self-report instrument used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms experienced during the week preceding the assessment. Specific scores were not provided, leaving the severity classification of his anxiety symptoms undetermined.





Information regarding the nature of his symptoms—whether primarily physiological or cognitive—and the presence of panic attacks were not detailed. This lack of specificity underscores the need for further assessment to clarify the impact of anxiety on Mr. Soufan’s daily functioning and his openness to therapeutic interventions. 

PTSD CHECKLIST – CIVILIAN VERSION (PCL-C)


Mr. Soufan completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL), a 17-item standardized self-report measure designed to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress over the past month, based on DSM-IV criteria. Unfortunately, the total score and whether it exceeds the clinical threshold for PTSD were not provided.





Without specific scores or symptom endorsements, such as re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional detachment, or arousal, the assessment lacks critical insights into the potential impact of trauma on Mr. Soufan’s functioning. This gap highlights the need for further evaluation to determine the necessity of trauma-informed care.
