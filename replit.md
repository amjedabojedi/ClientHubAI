## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with custom styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Design Principles**: Responsive (mobile-first), clean visual hierarchy, professional UI, color-coded indicators.
- **Date/Time Handling**:
    - Standardized display: "MMM dd, yyyy" for dates, "MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss" for timestamps.
    - **CRITICAL Timezone Handling**: ALL dates and times MUST consistently use `America/New_York` (EST/EDT) timezone for display and input interpretation, while storing in UTC in the database.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

- **Security**:
    - Role-based access control (Administrator, Clinical Supervisor, Therapist, Intern/Trainee) with 15 granular permissions.
    - Data isolation based on roles and supervisor assignments.
    - Authentication: `requireAuth` middleware for sensitive endpoints.
    - Authorization: Backend derives ALL access control decisions from `req.user` session context; never use user-supplied IDs/roles to prevent privilege escalation.

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Assessment Report System - Recent Fixes (October 2025)
The following issues were identified and **successfully resolved**:

1. âœ… **Hardcoded Therapist ID (SECURITY ISSUE) - FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Now uses authenticated user context (`user.id`) with validation guards
   - **Impact**: All assessment responses and assignments correctly attributed to the actual logged-in user
   - **Validation**: Added authentication checks to prevent saving with invalid user IDs

2. âœ… **Data Display Inconsistency - FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Standardized all response formats to show readable text
   - **Rating Display**: Now shows "Moderate (3)" instead of "Rating: 3"
   - **Options Display**: Shows "Option 1" instead of "Selected option 0"
   - **Impact**: Professional, consistent report formatting

3. âœ… **Confusing Assessment Workflow - FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive completion flow with dialogs
   - **New Workflow**:
     1. Click "Complete Assessment"
     2. View completion summary (questions answered/skipped)
     3. See validation warnings for required questions
     4. Confirm completion
     5. Choose next action via clear dialog buttons:
        - **Edit Assessment** â†’ Modify questions/answers
        - **View & Edit Report** â†’ Generate and work with AI report
   - **Regenerate Protection**: Added confirmation dialog warning about data loss

4. âœ… **Missing Completion Summary/Validation - FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive validation dialog showing:
     - Total questions count
     - Answered questions count
     - Skipped questions count
     - Warnings for unanswered required questions
   - **Impact**: Users see exactly what they've completed before finalizing

5. âœ… **Unfilled Questions Validation - FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Validation warnings now displayed for incomplete required sections
   - **Impact**: Users are informed about missing data before completion

6. âœ… **Assessment Action Buttons Redesigned - FIXED (Oct 14, 2025)**
   - **Solution**: Redesigned to match Session Notes pattern exactly
   - **New Design**:
     - Single primary action button (color-coded by status):
       - PENDING â†’ ðŸ”µ "Start Assessment" (blue) - Auto-updates status to "in_progress"
       - IN_PROGRESS â†’ ðŸŸ  "Continue Assessment" (orange)
       - COMPLETED â†’ ðŸŸ¢ "View Report" (green)
     - Dropdown menu (â‹®) with secondary actions (Edit Assessment, Delete)
   - **Status Management**: Clicking "Start Assessment" automatically changes status from "pending" to "in_progress"
   - **Impact**: Consistent UX with Session Notes, clear visual status indicators, organized action hierarchy

**Note**: Detailed AI-generated reports are intentional and necessary for proper clinical documentation.
