# Healthcare Process Checklists - Creation Guide

## Overview
Healthcare Process Checklists are standardized workflow tracking tools that ensure regulatory compliance and consistent care delivery. They are separate from client-specific tasks and focus on standardized processes that must be followed for all clients.

## Creating Checklist Templates

### Step 1: Navigate to Checklist Management
1. Go to Administration > Library (or navigate to `/checklist-management`)
2. Click on the "Checklist Templates" tab

### Step 2: Create a New Template
1. Click "Create Template" button
2. Fill in the template details:

**Template Fields:**
- **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Client Intake Process", "Discharge Planning")
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the checklist purpose
- **Category**: Select from:
  - `intake`: New client onboarding processes
  - `assessment`: Clinical evaluation procedures
  - `ongoing`: Regular care monitoring
  - `discharge`: Client closure procedures
- **Client Type**: Optional - restrict to specific client types
- **Sort Order**: Numeric order for display priority

### Step 3: Add Checklist Items
1. Switch to "Checklist Items" tab
2. Click "Add Item" button
3. Select the template you just created

**Item Fields:**
- **Template**: Select the parent template
- **Item Title**: Specific action to complete (e.g., "Verify insurance coverage")

## How Checklists Work

### Automatic Assignment
- When a new client is created, appropriate checklist templates are automatically assigned
- Templates are selected based on client type and stage
- Each client gets their own copy of the checklist items

### Progress Tracking
- Staff can mark individual items as complete
- Completion timestamps and user attribution are tracked
- Notes can be added to each completed item
- Overall progress is shown with progress bars

### Visual Indicators
- **Color-coded categories**: Blue (intake), Purple (assessment), Green (ongoing), Orange (discharge)
- **Required vs Optional**: Required items are clearly marked
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bars show completion percentage
- **Due dates**: Items show when they should be completed

## Best Practices

### Template Design
1. **Keep templates focused**: Each template should cover one major process
2. **Use clear titles**: Item titles should be action-oriented and specific
3. **Provide detailed descriptions**: Include enough detail for staff to complete tasks
4. **Set realistic timeframes**: Base days-from-start on actual workflow capabilities
5. **Mark compliance items as required**: Regulatory requirements should be mandatory

### Item Creation
1. **One action per item**: Don't combine multiple actions in one checklist item
2. **Include completion criteria**: Make it clear what constitutes completion
3. **Consider skill levels**: Ensure items can be completed by intended staff
4. **Order logically**: Arrange items in the sequence they should be completed

### Category Usage
- **Intake**: Use for all new client onboarding requirements
- **Assessment**: Use for clinical evaluation and treatment planning
- **Ongoing**: Use for regular monitoring and maintenance tasks
- **Discharge**: Use for client closure and transition planning

## Integration with Client Management

### Relationship to Tasks
- **Tasks**: Client-specific work items assigned to staff members
- **Checklists**: Standardized process steps that apply to all clients
- **Both**: Coexist to support comprehensive practice management

### Usage in Client Detail
- Checklists appear in the "Checklists" tab of client detail pages
- Tasks appear in the "Tasks" tab of client detail pages
- Staff can work with both systems for complete workflow management

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Templates define the standard processes
checklist_templates (id, name, description, category, client_type, sort_order)

-- Items define specific steps within each template
checklist_items (id, template_id, title, description, is_required, days_from_start, sort_order)

-- Client assignments create instances for each client
client_checklists (id, client_id, template_id, due_date, is_completed)

-- Client item completion tracking
client_checklist_items (id, client_checklist_id, checklist_item_id, is_completed, completed_at, completed_by, notes)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/checklist-templates` - Template management
- `GET/POST /api/checklist-items` - Item management
- `GET /api/clients/{id}/checklists` - Client checklist status
- `PUT /api/client-checklist-items/{id}` - Mark items complete

This system ensures standardized healthcare processes are consistently followed while maintaining flexibility for client-specific tasks and workflow management.
